## R Markdown (header)
### sub-header
#### another smaller sub-header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} 
#echo = false makes it where it only prints the output and not the code in the chunk, so  in this example, "plot(pressure)" doesnt show up in the document but the actual plot does show up.
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, name of chunk}
#command-option-I is the keyboard  shorthand to create a new chunk
```

```{r demo chunk, include=FALSE}
x = 1
y = 13
print(x+y)
```
